# 🎯 LuaLove
This app is a playground Löve2D and Lua.
So far, the user has to hunt an increasingly target with the cursor in order to score points by clicking on it. Sound effects gives audiovisual feedback.
The target gets bigger with every successful catch, but never over 100%. Of course, the target follows a physic and bounces off barriers.
Besides the code, components are also self-designed and are continuously developed. 
Feel free to help 💪


## Features
- Moving and shrinking target
- Rebound Physic
- Display of the score and high score in the session
- Sound effects
- Awesome design
